  "claims": [
    "2. **Healthcare Costs and Chronic Disease**: \"The U.S. spends $4.3 trillion on healthcare every year, 80% of which goes to chronic disease.\"",
    "2. **Hepatitis B Vaccine for Newborns**: \"why would you give Hepatitis B [vaccine] to a one-day-old baby\" questions the rationale behind the Hepatitis B vaccination schedule for newborns without considering the vertical (mother-to-child) transmission risk at birth, but without citing specific studies.",
    "**International Regulations and Studies on Wi-Fi**:",
    "1. **Chronic Disease in Children**: \"More than 54% of kids now have chronic disease.\"",
    "3. **Glyphosate Presence in Americans**: \"A recent study showed that a high percentage of Americans, somewhere in the 90% range, had glyphosate in their blood.\"",
    "4. **Glyphosate and Health Effects**: \"Glyphosate exposure is linked to many diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver, certain cancers, kidney diseases, and damage to the microbiome.\"",
    "7. **Atrazine and Reproductive Effects**: \"Atrazine exposure turned 10% of male frogs in a study into females that produced fertile eggs.\"",
    "3. **Nutritional Deficiencies and Immune Function**: People who are nutrient deficient have improperly functioning systems, and studies show that those admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 were often vitamin D deficient.",
    "7. **Regulatory and Pharmaceutical Industry Relationships**: Nearly 50% of FDA's budget comes from pharmaceutical companies; NIH employees working on medical products can collect royalties from those products, potentially influencing regulatory decisions or recommendations.",
    "8. **Pharmaceutical Advertising's Effects on Drug Consumption**: The United States, allowing direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising, leads to higher drug consumption compared to countries that do not allow such advertising.",
    "- **Claim**: Russia has stricter regulations on Wi-Fi and cell phone radiation due to its understanding of the technology as harmful, restricting use in schools and among children.",
    "5. **Roundup Ready Crops and Glyphosate Application**: \"95% of corn in the United States is now Roundup Ready corn...glyphosate all over it and it will do nothing to it.\"",
    "1. **Vaccine Efficacy**: The vaccine shows protection for the first two months but wanes into negative efficacy after 7 months, implying vaccination increases the likelihood of sickness.",
    "5. **Emergency Use Authorization Law**: Claims that the law stipulates an emergency use authorization for vaccines cannot be issued if there is an existing medication demonstrated to be effective against the illness.",
    "9. **COVID-19 Vaccine Development and NIH Involvement**: The claim that the NIH owns half the patent for the Moderna vaccine and that individuals within NIH can personally profit from its sales.",
    "- **Claim**: A relative risk of two is considered proof of causation in scientific research, provided there's biological plausibility.",
    "- **Claim**: More than 54% of children now have chronic disease, attributed partially to environmental and technological exposures since 1989.",
    "- **Claim**: There has been suppression, misinformation, and a shutdown of government-funded research in the United States regarding the health effects of Wi-Fi radiation.",
    "8. **COVID-19 Vaccine and Natural Immunity**: \"Studies were showing that natural immunity due to prior infection was seven times more effective than getting a vaccine.\"",
    "9. **COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Over Time**: \"The Cleveland Clinic study showed that vaccine efficacy wanes into negative efficacy after 7 months, meaning those vaccinated might be more likely to get sick.\"",
    "6. **Safe and Effective Vaccines**: Contradictory claims suggesting the vaccine could be harmful, based on adverse effect reporting and all-cause mortality rates in vaccine compared to placebo groups, with some specific figures mentioned (e.g., cardiac arrests).",
    "10. **Pandemic and Sudden Deaths Post-Vaccination**: There is a claim mentioning an increase in sudden deaths, particularly among athletes, post COVID-19 vaccination, suggesting a link between the vaccine and increased mortality in this group.",
    "1. **Mercury in Vaccines and Autism Correlation**: \"every freshwater fish in America at dangerous levels of mercury in its flesh\" notion is tied to broader environmental concerns over mercury, but the leap is made to vaccines with thimerosal (ethylmercury) and a supposition of triggering autism. No direct study or data source is mentioned for the autism claim within the portion related.",
    "4. **CDC's 2010 Study and Underreporting of Vaccine Injuries**: \"CDC did a study in 2010 called Lazarus...found 137: one in 37 kids had...potential vaccine claims.\" This claim refers to the Lazarus (2010) study but misinterprets its findings regarding vaccine adverse event reporting efficiencies rather than established causality of vaccine injuries. No link to the study is provided for context.",
    "5. **Thimerosal and Neurotoxicity**: \"Mercury is a thousand times more neurotoxic than lead\" and \"Ethyl mercury crosses the blood-brain barrier easier than methylmercury.\" While discussing thimerosal's (ethylmercury) impact, this simplifies the complex toxicology of mercury compounds and their pharmacokinetics. Specific toxicological studies or comparative analyses are not cited.",
    "- **Claim**: Wi-Fi and cell phone radiation opens up the blood-brain barrier, allowing toxins to enter the brain, thereby increasing the risk of cancer and other neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "6. **Glyphosate as a Tank Scalent**: \"Glyphosate was originally developed as a tank scalant.\"",
    "4. **Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine**: There were efforts to discredit these as treatments for COVID-19 to ensure the exclusive use of vaccines under emergency use authorization; claims involve giving lethal doses in some studies to discredit these treatments.",
    "6. **1989 as the Start of the Autism Epidemic and Vaccine Schedule Expansion**: Suggests a correlation between the expanded vaccine schedule in the late 80s and early 90s and the rise in autism diagnoses without presenting epidemiological data or research findings directly linking the two developments.",
    "- **Claim**: Aluminium in vaccines is causing an increase in allergies among the population.",
    "3. **Safety and Efficacy of Vaccines**: Claims that \"none of the 72 vaccines has ever been tested pre-licensing in a placebo control trial.\" This broad statement overlooks the varied and detailed regulatory requirements for vaccine approval, including safety and efficacy studies. No specific regulatory data or clinical trial outcomes are directly cited to support this.",
    "**Autism and Vaccines**:",
    "2. **Vitamin Supplementation**: Would have been better to give everybody Vitamin D as opposed to vaccinating them.",
    "- **Claim**: There is an 1135% increased risk of an autism diagnosis in children who received the hepatitis B vaccine within their first month of life compared to those who did not.",
