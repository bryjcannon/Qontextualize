"1. **Mercury in Vaccines**: Ethyl mercury, used as a preservative in some vaccines, is claimed to be rapidly excreted from the body and supposedly less harmful than methyl mercury found in fish. This is contrasted by the assertion that ethyl mercury crosses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently and could cause inflammation or damage by lodging in the brain.",3,false,"Fallback processing due to parsing error"
"2. **Vaccines and Autism**: The claim surfaces that vaccines, or specifically the mercury contained in some, could be linked to autism, particularly citing instances where children showed significant behavioral and developmental changes following vaccination.",3,false,"Fallback processing due to parsing error"
"3. **Vaccine Safety and Testing**: It is claimed that vaccines do not undergo placebo-controlled testing before licensing, suggesting an absence of rigorous safety evaluation compared to other medical products.",3,false,"Fallback processing due to parsing error"
